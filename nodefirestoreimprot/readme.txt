https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPzs6t3tQak   firebase import and export 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-firestore-import-export

I used the users.json file for data, but it should be stores.json obviously.


C:\src\nodestuff\nodefirestoreimprot>
firestore-import -a key.json -n stores -b users.json


each store has 3 images.  logo, storefront, misc. they are named
[storename]logo, [storename]storefront, [storename]
